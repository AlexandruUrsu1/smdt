MSU00298,,Akshit
MSU00299,Made on Friday 17th January Wire was bent when feeding into tension station Eventually snapped when tension was applied to it Possibly during the swaging station the wire was not carefully handled resulting in a weak wire --Comment made by Jason after discussing with Akshit.,Akshit
MSU00300,Same as MSU00299 The wire wasn't handled carefully and was weak when tension was applied to it The wire then snapped Wire is still threaded through endplug but not long enough to feed through tension system just like MSU00299  --Comment made by Jason,Akshit
